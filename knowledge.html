    <h1>Charging Infrastructure Development</h1>
    <p>Consumers and fleets considering electric vehicles—which include all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—need access to charging stations. For most drivers, this starts with charging at home or at fleet facilities. Charging stations at workplaces and public destinations may help bolster market acceptance by offering more flexible charging opportunities at commonly visited locations. Community leaders can find out more through EV readiness planning, including case studies of ongoing successes. The EVI-X Toolbox offers resources to estimate the charging infrastructure necessary to support typical daily travel in a given state or city, charging infrastructure needs to support long-distance travel (100 miles or more) along highway corridors in a given state or county, and to determine how EV charging will impact electricity demand.</p>
    <h1>Charging Infrastructure Terminology</h1>
    <p>The charging infrastructure industry has aligned with a common standard called the Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) protocol with this hierarchy for charging stations: location, EV charging port, and connector. The Alternative Fuels Data Center and the Station Locator use the following charging infrastructure definitions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Station Location: A station location is a site with one or more EV charging ports at the same address. Examples include a parking garage or a mall parking lot.</li>
        <li>EV Charging Port: An EV charging port provides power to charge only one vehicle at a time even though it may have multiple connectors. The unit that houses EV charging ports is sometimes called a charging post, which can have one or more EV charging ports. EV charging ports are also sometimes referred to as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) ports.</li>
        <li>Connector: A connector is what is plugged into a vehicle to charge it. Multiple connectors and connector types (such as CHAdeMO and CCS) can be available on one EV charging port, but only one vehicle will charge at a time. Connectors are sometimes called plugs.</li>
    </ul>
